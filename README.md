# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-approval-prediction-dataset)
- The dataset contains information like gender, marital status, income, credit history, etc.

## 🧠 Objective
Build a classification model to predict loan approval decisions, focusing on handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and dealing with class imbalance.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
2. **EDA**
   - Visualize distributions
   - Identify imbalance and correlations
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label encoding & One-Hot Encoding
4. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - Evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score
5. **Imbalanced Data Handling**
   - Applied SMOTE before model training for better class balance

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC Curve
